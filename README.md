# ToDo
* Figure out why logic_test case isn't learning!
* Implement better backpropogation (see later chapters in http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)
* Implement gradient descent (Strategy pattern?)
* Decide how to implement testing (protected methods, derived test class?)

# Immediate ToDo
* Add a method to push through a batch of training examples (addToBatch and performGradientStep, perhaps)
* In fact, maybe the above should be methods of a member object (StochasticGradientDescent class, perhaps)

# Long-term todos:
* Switch to using BLAS.

# Stuff I need to know:
* How do I select the appropriate learning rate?
